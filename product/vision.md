# Vision

Vision is an ambiguous word, that we often glorify and say that vision is all that matters.

Vision matters, but it's not a spark of genius originating from a CEO and that's intangible to others.

Vision is in fact much simpler, having a vision is having a deep understanding of a meaningful problem, and knowing the technical solutions that will get your there.

A vision without a product or a technical understanding are dreams, dreams are bad because they're ephemeral and do not provide anything tangible to the world.

> Everyone has a dream, few have vision.

Without execution you go nowhere, without vision you are lost.
